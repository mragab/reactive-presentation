== Today's plan

. Functional Programming
. Reactive Programming
. Actor Model
. Messaging Patterns
. Event Sourcing and CQRS
. Domain Modeling
. Microservices
. DevOps and Continuous Delivery

== Show of hands

.Who is familiar with
[%step]
* Functional Programming
* Reactive Programming
* Actor Model
* Event Sourcing
* CQRS
* Microservices
* DevOps

== Show of hands

.Who is doing
[%step]
* Functional Programming
* Scala & Akka
* Microservices
* DevOps

== What is Functional Programming

[%step]
* Programming with functions
* Functions as the primary unit of abstraction
* Kingdom of verbs as opposed to kingdom of nouns

== What is it not

[quote, You only feel this for real as you learn it]
____
**It is not a new programming language syntax**
____

== What is a pure function

[%step]
* Input
* Processing
* Output
* No dependence on global state
* No side effects

== What is a side effect

[quote, Paul Chiusano Rúnar Bjarnason - Functional Programming in Scala]
____
A function has a side effect if it does something other than simply return a result
____

== What is a side effect

[quote, Paul Chiusano Rúnar Bjarnason - Functional Programming in Scala]
____
.for example:
* Modifying a variable
* Modifying a data structure in place
* Setting a field on an object
* Throwing an exception
* Halting with an error
____


== What is a side effect

[quote, Paul Chiusano Rúnar Bjarnason - Functional Programming in Scala]
____
.for example:
* Printing to the console
* Reading user input
* Reading from or writing to a file
* Drawing on the screen
____

== Where to go from here

* Coursera: Functional Programming in Scala Specialization
* Book: Bruce Eckel. “Atomic Scala 2nd Edition.”
* Book: Paul Chiusano Rúnar Bjarnason. “Functional Programming in Scala.”
* Book: Martin Odersky. “Programming in Scala, Third Edition”
* Book: Vaughn Vernon. “Reactive Messaging Patterns with the Actor Model: Applications and Integration in Scala and Akka”
